Before installing, make sure you have at least version 1.1 of the java
developement kit installed.  If you want to run this program you only
need the java runtime environment.  Version 1.1 is quite old, I
recommend using Java 2 (jdk1.2 or above).  You need perl if you want
to compile a 1.1 version.

This package was designed to use the ANT from the jakarta.apache.org
tools.  I assume you have installed it correctly. 

Take some time to edit config.props.  There are a few options you need
to take care of.  (Unfortunately ant can't test for executables).

Now you are ready to invoke ant.  There are many possible targets, here
are the most useful ones:

all       builds class files and documentation.
build     builds class files only (autodetects java version).
build-1.1 builds JDK1.1 class files.
doc       builds documentation.
dist      creates all release files.
test      does some self tests.  You need to have junit installed for this.
clean     cleans everything that doesn't belong to the source distribution.
cvsclean  cleans everything that doesn't belong into the cvs repository.
